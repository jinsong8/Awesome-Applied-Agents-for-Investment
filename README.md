# Awesome Applied Agents for Investment

A curated, structured collection of papers and artifacts on LLMs, agentic systems, and
applied AI for investment research, trading, risk, and financial text analysis. The goal
is to make it easy to browse the landscape, compare approaches, and build reading packs
for focused study or replication.

## Tools

The `tools/` folder includes scripts for:
- extracting text from PDFs,
- scanning sections across papers,
- generating reading packets.

If you add new PDFs, place them in the appropriate category and (optionally) rerun the
tooling to update extracted artifacts and reading packets.
